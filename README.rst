This repo contains code and tests for the first assignment of the CS3012 module in Computer Science at Trinity College
Dublin.

Implementation of the LCA (`Lowest common ancestor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor>`_) are
provided for:

- `Binary trees <https://devplayer0.github.io/cs3012/tree.html>`_
- `Directed acyclic graphs <https://devplayer0.github.io/cs3012/dag.html>`_

Click the badges above for `test results`_, documentation_ and coverage_.

``master`` contains the combined code of the binary tree and DAG implementations (along with their corresponding unit tests).
``tree`` contains only the binary implementation and ``dag`` is a branch where the DAG implementation was developed.
